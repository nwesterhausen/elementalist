### UI

The UI is using some fonts to evoke ancient engraving for many display elements. For the player's spellbook, skills, and other notes a handwriting font is used. It's optional for the player to change the fonts used to be easier to read if desired.

### Controls

Can use keyboard & mouse or gamepad. The player can move, cast a primary, secondary, defensive or ultimate spell, and pause the game (while in a realm).
