# Design Notes

These are design notes but also more of a reference. (As of now) they are all generated automatically from the files in [game_data](../game_data).

## Design Tools

I use [Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) to jot down design ideas while on the go, and the desktop apps make reviewing the information easy.

For managing my backlog I am using [ClickUp](https://app.clickup.com).
