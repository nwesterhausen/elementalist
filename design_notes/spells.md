# Spellwork

What spells are possible, and what schools / types are there.

## Overview

There are tiers of spells, and they correspond to the complexity of the element/magic.

- Tier 0: 3 Basic elements
  - [Fire](#fire)
  - [Lightning](#lightning)
  - [Water](#water)
- Tier 1: magic as a combo from Tier 0
  - [Earth](#earth) (fire + water = earth)
  - [Air](#air) (lighting => air)
  - [Ice](#ice) (water => ice)
  - [Force](#force) (lightning + water = force)
- Tier 2: arcane magics
  - [Light](#light)
  - [Darkness](#darkness)
  - [Arcane](#arcane)
- Tier 3: life and death
  - [Life](#life)
  - [Death](#death)
- Tier 4: self-enhancement
  - [Enchancement](#enhancement)
- Tier 5: summoning and transformation
  - [Summoning](#summoning)
  - [Necromancy](#necromancy)
  - [Polymorph](#polymorph)

While in the primal realm, spells can be upgraded by the magics there gaining additional effects and even effects from different schools.

## Deployment

Before entering the realm, the elementalist can prepare with a single "primary" school of magic, a "secondary" school, and a "defensive" school.

Magic slotted to a primary slot will not cost mana to cast, but the spell will be something like a cantrip.

Magic in the secondary slot will cost a variable amount of mana (1 or 2) and will be more powerful and offer a couple choices when selecting.

Magic in the defensive slot will cost 1 mana to cast and does something like shield, dash, or some other "get out of trouble" effect.

While in the realm, an ultimate slot can be discovered with a random school of magic. It will cost 2 - 4 mana to cast and has debilitating effects.

When the game starts, only the primary slot is available. Then more is unlocked as the elementalist levels up.

Each school of magic will have its own level that grows when casting, doing damage, or spending elemental essence for that school. As the spells level up, they can do more base damage, have shorter cooldowns, and other boons.
