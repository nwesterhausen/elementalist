# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are welcome as long as they are in the spirit of the game or help improve it.

1. Fork the project
2. (optional, but desired) Open an Issue for what you are doing
3. Make a pull request
4. If the checks pass and code reviewed then it can be merged for the next release (Thanks!)

There are no requirements for having an issue before working on code but that would be considered polite (so if it is your idea, open an issue first).

## Spells, assets, and other "low-code/no-code" contributions

Pull requests welcome that are not code related as well. Please follow same steps as above.

If discussion needs to happen about changes it can be in the pull request or issue connected to the PR.
