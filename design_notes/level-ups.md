# Level Ups

The experience curve we are using:

![(x - 1)^(a/b)/c + C](../docs/img/experience-curve.gif)

And using these values:

| Var | Value |
| --- | ----- |
| *a* | 10    |
| *b* | 5     |
| *c* | 5     |
| C   | 10    |

Anything fractional is rounded down to the nearest integer.

| Level | XP from `level - 1` to get there |

| 1     | 10                               |
